all assembly has been written in 'old style' for the VASM compiller

all of the syntax information can be found here

the K17 emulator can be downloaded from here

to use the 'tiles to binary' tool, drag and drop a black and white image with the tiles you wish to import, then tell it however many blank tiles there are (assuming no blank tiles are in the middle of the image) and then tell it to which tile ID you want to start importing to, in decimal.

with the included demonstration charset, there is 1 blank tile at the end, and it should be imported to ID 32 (the location of the ascii space character).
